# Art-Generation-with-Deep-Learning

ImplementedNeural Style Transfer (NST)algorithm to generate artistic imagesby optimizing a target image to resemble the content statistics of the content imageand the style statistics of the style reference image.

VGG19, a 19-layer version of the VGG network trained on the ImageNet database was used to extract the feature maps of the content, style, and generated images.
