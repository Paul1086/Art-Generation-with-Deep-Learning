# Art-Generation-with-Deep-Learning

Implemented Neural Style Transfer (NST) algorithm to generate artistic images by optimizing a target image to resemble the content statistics of the content image and the style statistics of the style reference image.

VGG19, a 19-layer version of the VGG network trained on the ImageNet database was used to extract the feature maps of the content, style, and generated images.
